# FedoraKDEAutoConfig
Script to automatically configure Fedora (39, for now) KDE to automatically add RPM Fusion and Flathub repositories.

This script installs both free **and non-free** repositories from RPM Fusion. It also installs neofetch (because we all love it and Fedora doesn't provide it automatically) and Wine from WineHQ (stable).

I made this to simplify *my* process in installing Fedora, so feel free to fork this project and add the changes you need.
